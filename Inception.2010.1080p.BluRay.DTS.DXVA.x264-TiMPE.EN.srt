2
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,600
Are you here to kill me?

3
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,800
I know what this is.

4
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,000
I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.

5
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,500
It belonged to a man I met
in a half-remembered dream.

6
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,600
A man possessed
of some radical notions.

7
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,400
What is the most resilient parasite?

8
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,000
A bacteria? A virus?

9
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,900
An intestinal worm?

10
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,400
Uh....

11
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,200
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say--

12
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,600
An idea.

13
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,400
Resilient. Highly contagious.

14
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain,
it's almost impossible to eradicate.

15
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,300
An idea that is fully formed,
fully understood, that sticks.

16
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,700
Right in there somewhere.

17
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,400
For someone like you to steal?

18
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,500
Yes. In the dream state,
your conscious defenses are lowered...

19
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,100
...and that makes your thoughts
vulnerable to theft.

20
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,500
It's called extraction.

21
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,200
Mr. Saito, we can train
your subconscious to defend itself...

22
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,900
...from even the most skilled extractor.

23
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,300
How can you do that?

24
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,300
Because I am the most skilled extractor.

25
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,100
I know how to search your mind
and find your secrets. I know the tricks.

26
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,200
And I can teach them to you,
so that even when you're asleep...

27
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,700
...your defense is never down.

28
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,500
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna
have to be completely open with me.

29
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,100
I need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your wife...

30
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,500
...better than your therapist,
better than anyone.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,600
If this is a dream,
and you have a safe full of secrets...

32
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,200
...I need to know what's in that safe.

33
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,800
In order for this all to work,
you need to completely let me in.

34
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,300
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen,
as I consider your proposal.

35
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
He knows.

36
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,300
What's going on up there?

37
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,200
Saito knows. He's playing with us.

38
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,900
Doesn't matter. I can get it here.
Trust me.

39
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,600
The information is in the safe.

40
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,900
He looked right at it
when I mentioned secrets.

41
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,300
What's she doing here?

42
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,100
Just head back to the room.
All right? I'll take care of this.

43
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,300
Okay, make sure you do.
We're here to work.

44
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,400
If I jumped, would I survive?

45
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,200
With a clean dive, perhaps.

46
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,000
Mal, what are you doing here?

47
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,400
I thought you might be missing me.

48
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,800
You know that I am.

49
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,900
But I can't trust you anymore.

50
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,000
So what?

51
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,700
Looks like Arthur's taste.

52
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,500
Actually, the subject is partial
to postwar British painters.

53
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,900
Please, have a seat.

54
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,100
Tell me...

55
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,100
...do the children miss me?

56
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,100
You can't imagine.

57
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,400
What are you doing?

58
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,100
Just getting some fresh air.

59
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,300
Stay where you are, Mal.

60
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,800
Goddamn it.

61
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,300
Turn around.

62
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,500
The gun, Dom.

63
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,900
Please.

64
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,400
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

65
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,200
Did she tell you?
Or have you known all along?

66
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,600
That you're here to steal from me,
or that we are actually asleep?

67
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,100
I want to know the name
of your employer.

68
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,900
Ah, there's no use threatening him
in a dream, right, Mal?

69
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,600
That depends
on what you're threatening.

70
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,600
Killing him would just wake him up.

71
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,600
But pain....

72
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,400
Pain is in the mind.

73
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,300
And judging by the decor,
we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

74
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,800
- What are you doing? It's too soon.
- But the dream's collapsing.

75
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,400
I'm gonna try to keep Saito under
a little bit longer. We're almost there.

76
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,600
He was close. Very close.

77
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,500
Stop him!

78
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,500
This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.

79
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,300
He won't wake.

80
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,000
- Give him the kick.
- What?

81
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Dunk him.

82
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,500
He's out.

83
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,900
You came prepared, hmm?

84
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,900
Not even my head of security knows
this apartment. How did you find it?

85
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,300
It's difficult for a man of your position
to keep a love nest like this secret...

86
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,000
...particularly where there's
a married woman involved.

87
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,100
- She would never....
- Yet here we are.

88
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,300
- With a dilemma.
- They're getting closer.

89
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,200
- You got what you came for.
- Well, that's not true.

90
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,000
You left out a key piece of information,
didn't you?

91
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,400
You held something back
because you knew what we were up to.

92
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,400
- Question is, why'd you let us in at all?
- An audition.

93
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,600
- An audition for what?
- Doesn't matter. You failed.

94
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,500
We extracted every bit of information
you had in there.

95
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,200
But your deception was obvious.

96
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,500
- So leave me and go.
- You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.

97
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,900
That corporation that hired us,
they won't accept failure.

98
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,200
We won't last two days.

99
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,300
Cobb?

100
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,600
Looks like I'm gonna have to do this
a little more simply.

101
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,600
Tell us what you know!
Tell us what you know, now!

102
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,800
I've always hated this carpet.

103
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,300
It's stained and frayed
in such distinctive ways.

104
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,200
But very definitely made of wool.

105
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,700
Right now...

106
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,200
...I'm lying on polyester.

107
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,900
Which means I'm not lying
on my carpet, in my apartment.

108
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,000
You have lived up to your reputation,
Mr. Cobb.

109
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
I'm still dreaming.

110
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,000
- How'd it go?
- Not good.

111
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,500
Dream within a dream, huh?
I'm impressed.

112
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,300
But in my dream, you play by my rules.

113
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,700
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito....

114
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,300
We're not in your dream.

115
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,000
We're in mine.

116
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,100
Asshole.
How do you mess up the carpet?

117
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,500
- It wasn't my fault.
- You're the architect.

118
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,800
I didn't know
he was gonna rub his cheek on it!

119
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,100
That's enough.

120
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,700
You. What the hell was all that?

121
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,100
- I have it under control.
- I'd hate to see you out of control.

122
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,000
We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.

123
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,000
He's not gonna check every compartment.

124
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,800
Yeah, well, I don't like trains.

125
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,800
Listen. Every man for himself.

126
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,200
Yes, hello?

127
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,000
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Dad.

128
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,100
Hey, guys. Hey. How are you?
How you doing, huh?

129
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,500
- Good.
- Okay, I guess.

130
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,400
Okay? Who's just okay?
Is that you, James?

131
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,500
Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?

132
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,100
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't.
Not for a while, remember?

133
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,600
Why?

134
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,500
Look, I told you, I'm away
because I'm working, right?

135
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,700
Grandma says you're never coming back.

136
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,200
Phillipa, is that you?

137
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,500
Put Grandma on the phone for me,
will you?

138
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,400
She's shaking her head.

139
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,000
Well, just hope she's wrong about that.

140
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,100
Daddy?

141
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Yeah, James?

142
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,700
Is Mommy with you?

143
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,500
James, we talked about this.

144
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,200
Mommy's not here anymore.

145
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,500
Where?

146
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,800
That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.

147
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Listen, I'm gonna send some presents
with Grandpa, all right?

148
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
And you be good, you be--

149
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,900
- Our ride's on the roof.
- Right.

150
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,300
Hey, are you okay?

151
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,300
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

152
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,900
Well, down in the dream,
Mal showing up.

153
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,300
Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg.
Won't happen again.

154
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,100
- It's getting worse, isn't it?
- One apology's all you're getting, all right?

155
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,700
- Where's Nash?
- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

156
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,400
We were supposed to deliver
Saito's expansion plans...

157
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,300
...to Cobol Engineering two hours ago.

158
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,700
By now, they know we failed.
It's time we disappear.

159
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,700
- Where you gonna go?
- Buenos Aires.

160
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,200
I can lie low there, maybe sniff out
a job when things quiet down. You?

161
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,500
Stateside.

162
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,200
Send my regards.

163
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,200
He sold you out. Thought to come
to me and bargain for his life.

164
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,100
So I offer you the satisfaction.

165
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,600
It's not the way I deal with things.

166
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,800
- What will you do with him?
- Nothing.

167
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,700
But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.

168
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,200
- What do you want from us?
- Inception.

169
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,200
- Is it possible?
- Of course not.

170
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,500
If you can steal an idea
from someone's mind...

171
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,600
...why can't you plant one there instead?

172
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
Okay, here's me planting
an idea in your head.

173
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,300
I say, "Don't think about elephants."
What are you thinking about?

174
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Elephants.

175
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,900
Right. But it's not your idea,
because you know I gave it to you.

176
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,000
The subject's mind can always trace
the genesis of the idea.

177
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,400
- True inspiration's impossible to fake.
- That's not true.

178
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,000
- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?

179
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,900
Because I can find my own way
to square things with Cobol.

180
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,100
Then you do have a choice.

181
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,000
Then I choose to leave, sir.

182
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,600
Tell the crew where you want to go.

183
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,000
Hey, Mr. Cobb.

184
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,200
How would you like to go home?

185
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,300
To America. To your children.

186
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,100
You can't fix that. No one can.

187
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,500
- Just like inception.
- Cobb, come on.

188
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,100
- How complex is the idea?
- Simple enough.

189
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,800
No idea is simple when you need
to plant it in somebody else's mind.

190
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,700
My main competitor is
an old man in poor health.

191
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,700
His son will soon inherit control
of the corporation.

192
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,100
I need him to decide to break up
his father's empire.

193
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,500
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.

194
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,800
If I were to do this,
if I even could do it...

195
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,900
...I'd need a guarantee.

196
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,300
- How do I know you can deliver?
- You don't.

197
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,400
But I can.

198
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,600
So do you want to take a leap of faith...

199
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,900
...or become an old man,
filled with regret...

200
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,600
...waiting to die alone?

201
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,000
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.

202
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,900
Look, I know how much
you wanna go home.

203
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,500
This can't be done.

204
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,900
Yes, it can.
Just have to go deep enough.

205
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,600
You don't know that.

206
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,800
I've done it before.

207
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,200
Who'd you do it to?

208
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Why are we going to Paris?

209
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,700
We're gonna need a new architect.

210
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,700
You never did like your office, did you?

211
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,600
No space to think
in that broom cupboard.

212
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,700
Is it safe for you to be here?

213
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,300
Extradition between France
and the United States...

214
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,700
...is a bureaucratic nightmare,
you know that.

215
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,600
I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case.

216
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,300
Look, l, uh, brought these for you to give
to the kids when you have a chance.

217
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,000
It'll take more than
the occasional stuffed animal...

218
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,200
...to convince those children
they still have a father.

219
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.

220
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,900
I never taught you to be a thief.

221
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,300
No, you taught me to navigate
people's minds.

222
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,700
But after what happened...

223
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,500
...there weren't a whole lot of legitimate
ways for me to use that skill.

224
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,100
What are you doing here, Dom?

225
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,600
I think I found a way home.

226
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,300
It's a job
for some very, very powerful people.

227
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,000
People who I believe can fix
my charges permanently.

228
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,100
But I need your help.

229
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,100
You're here to corrupt
one of my brightest and best.

230
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,100
You know what I'm offering.
Let them decide for themselves.

231
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,800
- Money.
- Not just money.

232
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,300
You remember.

233
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,700
It's the chance to build cathedrals,
entire cities...

234
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,600
...things that never existed...

235
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,000
...things that couldn't exist
in the real world.

236
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,300
So you want me to let someone else
follow you into your fantasy?

237
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,400
They don't actually come into the dream.

238
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,900
They just design the levels
and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.

239
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,300
Design it yourself.

240
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,400
Mal won't let me.

241
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,800
Come back to reality, Dom.

242
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,700
- Please.
- Reality.

243
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,600
Those kids, your grandchildren...

244
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,800
...they're waiting for their father to come
back home. That's their reality.

245
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,100
And this job, this last job,
that's how I get there.

246
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,300
I would not be standing here
if I knew any other way.

247
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,400
I need an architect
who's as good as I was.

248
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
I've got somebody better.

249
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
Ariadne?

250
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,900
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

251
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,400
Pleased to meet you.

252
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,300
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has
a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.

253
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,500
A work placement?

254
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,200
Not exactly.

255
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,700
I have a test for you.

256
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,500
You're not gonna tell me anything first?

257
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,300
Before I describe the job,
I have to know you can do it.

258
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,700
- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

259
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,400
You have two minutes to design a maze
that it takes one minute to solve.

260
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,500
Stop.

261
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,100
Again.

262
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,600
Stop.

263
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
You're gonna have to do better than that.

264
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,100
That's more like it.

265
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,200
They say we only use a fraction
of our brain's true potential.

266
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,100
Now, that's when we're awake.

267
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,200
When we're asleep,
our mind can do almost anything.

268
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
Such as?

269
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,600
Imagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.

270
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,600
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself, if you know what I mean.

271
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,700
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.

272
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,200
Genuine inspiration, right?

273
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,700
Now, in a dream,
our mind continuously does this.

274
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,500
We create and perceive
our world simultaneously.

275
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,000
And our mind does this so well
that we don't even know it's happening.

276
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,900
That allows us to get right
in the middle of that process.

277
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,500
- How?
- By taking over the creating part.

278
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,300
Now, this is where I need you.

279
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,800
You create the world of the dream.

280
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,400
We bring the subject into that dream,
and they fill it with their subconscious.

281
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,200
How could I ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality?

282
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,800
Well, dreams, they feel real
while we're in them, right?

283
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,700
It's only when we wake up that we realize
something was actually strange.

284
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,600
Let me ask you a question.

285
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,100
You never really remember
the beginning of a dream, do you?

286
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,300
You always wind up
right in the middle of what's going on.

287
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,500
I guess, yeah.

288
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,300
So how did we end up here?

289
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,700
Well, we just came from the, uh....

290
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,400
Think about it, Ariadne.
How did you get here?

291
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,900
Where are you right now?

292
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,400
We're dreaming?

293
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,000
You're in the middle
of the workshop, sleeping.

294
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,100
This is your first lesson
in shared dreaming. Stay calm.

295
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,600
If it's just a dream,
then why are you--?

296
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,900
Because it's never just a dream, is it?

297
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,400
And a face full of glass hurts like hell.
When you're in it, it feels real.

298
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,800
That's why the military
developed dream sharing.

299
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,700
It was a training program for soldiers
to shoot, stab and strangle each other...

300
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,000
...and then wake up.

301
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,100
How did architects become involved?

302
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,000
Well, someone had to design
the dreams, right?

303
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,400
Why don't you give us
another five minutes?

304
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,700
Five minutes?

305
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,400
What--? We were talking
for, like, at least an hour.

306
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,800
In a dream, your mind
functions more quickly...

307
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,800
...therefore time seems
to feel more slow.

308
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,300
Five minutes in the real world
gives you an hour in the dream.

309
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,100
Why don't you see what you
can get up to in five minutes?

310
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,000
You've got the basic layout.
Bookstore, cafe.

311
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,800
Almost everything else is here too.

312
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,900
- Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.

313
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,300
- Yours?
- Yes.

314
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,000
Remember, you are the dreamer.
You build this world.

315
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,800
I am the subject. My mind populates it.

316
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,900
You can literally talk
to my subconscious.

317
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,900
That's one of the ways we extract
information from the subject.

318
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,400
How else do you do it?

319
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,500
By creating something secure,
like a bank vault or a jail.

320
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,500
The mind automatically fills it
with information it's trying to protect.

321
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,400
- You understand?
- Then you break in and steal it?

322
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Well....

323
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,300
I guess I thought that the dream space
would be all about the visual...

324
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,300
...but it's more about the feel of it.

325
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,900
My question is what happens when you
start messing with the physics of it all?

326
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,800
It's something, isn't it?

327
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,200
Yes, it is.

328
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,700
Why are they all looking at me?

329
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,300
Because my subconscious feels that
someone else is creating this world.

330
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,800
The more you change things, the quicker
the projections start to converge on you.

331
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Converge?

332
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,300
They sense the foreign nature
of the dreamer.

333
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,100
They attack, like white blood cells
fighting an infection.

334
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,100
- What, they're gonna attack us?
- No, no.

335
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,300
Just you.

336
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,400
This is great, but I'm telling you,
if you keep changing things like this....

337
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,900
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious
to take it easy?

338
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,700
It's my subconscious.
Remember? I can't control it.

339
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,800
Very impressive.

340
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,000
I know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?

341
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,500
Yeah, I cross it every day
to get to the college.

342
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,200
Never re-create places from your memory.
Always imagine new places.

343
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,200
You draw from stuff you know, right?

344
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,500
Only use details. A streetlamp
or a phone booth. Never entire areas.

345
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,800
- Why not?
- Building a dream from your memory...

346
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,500
...is the easiest way to lose your grasp
on what's real and what is a dream.

347
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,700
- Is that what happened to you?
- Listen to me.

348
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
This has nothing to do
with me, understand?

349
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,000
That why you need me
to build your dreams?

350
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,700
Hey, get off of her. Back up. Back up.

351
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,500
- Cobb! Cobb!
- Get off of her!

352
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,600
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Mal!

353
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,200
- Mal!
- Cobb! Wake me up!

354
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,200
- Wake me up! Wake me up!
- No!

355
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,900
- Mal, no! No!
- Wake me up!

356
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,500
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.

357
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,900
- Hey.
- Why wouldn't I wake up?

358
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,800
There was still time on the clock.

359
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,500
You can't wake up from
within the dream unless you die.

360
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,300
- She'll need a totem.
- What?

361
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,900
A totem, it's a small personal--

362
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,600
That's some subconscious
you've got on you, Cobb!

363
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,600
- She's a real charmer.
- Oh.

364
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,400
- I see you met Mrs. Cobb.
- She's his wife?

365
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,300
Yeah. So a totem. You need
a small object, potentially heavy.

366
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,000
Something you can have on you
that no one else knows.

367
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,400
- Like a coin?
- No.

368
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,200
It needs to be more unique than that.
Like, this is a loaded die.

369
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,200
No, I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.

370
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,600
See, only I know the balance and
the weight of this particular loaded die.

371
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,600
That way,
when you look at your totem...

372
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,800
...you know beyond a doubt that
you're not in someone else's dream.

373
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,600
I don't know if you can't see what's
going on, or if you just don't want to...

374
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,300
...but Cobb has some serious problems
that he's tried to bury down there.

375
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,400
And I'm not about to just open my mind
to someone like that.

376
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,900
She'll be back. I've never seen anyone
pick it up that quickly before.

377
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,600
Reality's not gonna be enough for her now,
and when she comes back....

378
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,900
When she comes back,
you're gonna have her building mazes.

379
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,400
- Where are you gonna be?
- I gotta go visit Eames.

380
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,700
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.
It's Cobol's back yard.

381
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,400
It's a necessary risk.

382
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,100
- Well, there's plenty of good thieves.
- We don't just need a thief.

383
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
We need a forger.

384
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,500
Rub them together all you want,
they're not gonna breed.

385
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,100
You never know.

386
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,100
I'm gonna get you a drink.

387
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,600
You're buying.

388
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,400
- Your spelling hasn't improved.
- Piss off.

389
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,500
How's your handwriting?

390
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,500
- It's versatile.
- Good.

391
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,900
Thank you very much.

392
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,000
Inception.

393
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,100
Now, before you bother telling me
it's impossible, let me--

394
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,500
No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.

395
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,000
Interesting. Because Arthur keeps
telling me it can't be done.

396
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Hmm. Arthur. You still working
with that stick in the mud?

397
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,200
He is good at what he does, right?

398
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,500
Oh, he's the best,
but he has no imagination.

399
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,700
Not like you.

400
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Listen, if you're gonna perform inception,
you need imagination.

401
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,500
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?

402
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,300
We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place,
but it didn't take.

403
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,800
- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.

404
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You need the simplest version
of the idea...

405
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,900
...in order for it to grow naturally
in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.

406
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,600
So, what is this idea
that you need to plant?

407
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,900
We need the heir of a major corporation
to dissolve his father's empire.

408
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,500
Right there you have
various political motivations...

409
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,700
...and anti-monopolistic sentiments
and so forth.

410
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,700
But all of that stuff, it's, um....

411
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,700
It's really at the mercy of your
subject's prejudice, you see?

412
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,400
What you have to do is
start at the absolute basic.

413
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,100
Which is what?

414
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,500
The relationship with the father.

415
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,400
- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.

416
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Right. Okay, well,
there's a man here, Yusuf.

417
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,300
He, uh, formulates his own versions
of the compounds.

418
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,700
Why don't you take me there?

419
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,000
Once you've lost your tail.
The man at the bar.

420
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,600
Cobol Engineering.

421
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,100
That price on my head,
was that dead or alive?

422
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,800
Don't remember.
Let's see if he starts shooting.

423
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,600
Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs
in the bar in, say, uh, half an hour?

424
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,800
- Back here?
- This is the last place they'd suspect.

425
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,600
All right.

426
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,600
Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.

427
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,300
My God, it's you, isn't it?

428
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,900
No, it isn't you.

429
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,500
Not dreaming now, are you?

430
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,300
Get him!

431
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,900
There!

432
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,200
One cafe.

433
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,700
Shh.

434
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,800
One cafe.

435
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,300
One cafe.

436
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,400
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

437
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,100
- What are you doing in Mombasa?
- I'm here to protect my investment.

438
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,500
Ah. So this is your idea
of losing a tail, huh?

439
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,700
Different tail.

440
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,200
Cobb said you'd be back.

441
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,800
- I tried not to come, but....
- But there's nothing quite like it.

442
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,700
It's just...

443
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,500
...pure creation.

444
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,200
Shall we take a look
at some paradoxical architecture?

445
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,300
You're gonna have to master
a few tricks...

446
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,000
...if you're gonna build three complete
dream levels. Excuse me.

447
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,600
What kind of tricks?

448
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,300
In a dream, you can cheat architecture
into impossible shapes.

449
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,400
That lets you create closed loops,
like the Penrose Steps.

450
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,200
The infinite staircase.

451
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,400
See?

452
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Paradox.

453
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,200
So a closed loop like that...

454
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,500
...will help you disguise the boundaries
of the dream you create.

455
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
But how big do these levels have to be?

456
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,900
It could be anything
from the floor of a building to an entire city.

457
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,500
They have to be complicated enough
that we can hide from the projections.

458
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,100
- A maze?
- Right, a maze.

459
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,600
And the better the maze....

460
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,400
Then the longer we have
before the projections catch us?

461
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,900
Exactly.

462
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,200
- My subconscious seems polite enough.
- Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.

463
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,300
No one likes to feel someone else
messing around in their mind.

464
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,500
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

465
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,200
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.

466
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,800
He thinks it's safer
if he doesn't know the layouts.

467
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,000
Why?

468
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,400
He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.

469
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,200
- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.

470
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,500
- They're still together?
- No.

471
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,200
No, she's dead.

472
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,900
What you see in there
is just his projection of her.

473
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,000
What was she like in real life?

474
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,200
She was lovely.

475
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,200
- You are seeking a chemist?
- Yes.

476
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,500
To formulate compounds for a job?

477
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,100
And to go into the field with us.

478
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,500
No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.

479
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,400
Well, we'd need you there to tailor
compounds specific to our needs.

480
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,600
- Which are?
- Great depth.

481
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,100
A dream within a dream? Two levels?

482
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,900
Three.

483
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,600
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

484
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,800
It is possible.
You just have to add a sedative.

485
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,600
A powerful sedative.

486
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,600
- How many team members?
- Five.

487
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,500
Six.

488
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,400
The only way to know you've done the job
is if I go in with you.

489
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,700
There's no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr. Saito.

490
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,200
This time, it seems there is.

491
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,900
This, I think, is a good place to start.
I use it every day.

492
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,200
- What for?
- Here, I'll show you.

493
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,300
Perhaps you will not want to see.

494
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,800
After you.

495
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,100
Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.

496
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,000
They come every day to share the dream.

497
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,600
You see? Very stable.

498
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,400
- How long do they dream for?
- Three, four hours, each day.

499
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,700
In dream time?

500
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,600
With this compound? About 40 hours,
each and every day.

501
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,000
- Why do they do it?
- Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

502
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,000
After a while, it becomes
the only way you can dream.

503
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,100
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

504
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,100
- They come here every day to sleep?
- No.

505
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,600
They come to be woken up.

506
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,900
The dream has become their reality.

507
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,200
Who are you to say otherwise, sir?

508
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,100
Let's see what you can do.

509
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,700
You know how to find me.

510
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,300
You know what you have to do.

511
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,600
Sharp, no?

512
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,000
Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?

513
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,300
Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine.

514
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,500
Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer Morrow
energy conglomerate.

515
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,600
What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?

516
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,300
That's not your concern.

517
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:45,100
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical
corporate espionage.

518
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,900
You asked me for inception.

519
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,400
I do hope you understand
the gravity of that request.

520
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,500
Now, the seed that we plant
in this man's mind will grow into an idea.

521
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,600
This idea will define him.

522
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,600
It may come to change....

523
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,000
Well, it may come to change
everything about him.

524
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,500
We're the last company standing
between them and total energy dominance.

525
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,800
And we can no longer compete.

526
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,400
Soon, they'll control the energy supply
of half the world.

527
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,000
In effect, they become
a new superpower.

528
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,700
The world needs Robert Fischer
to change his mind.

529
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,400
That's where we come in.

530
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,900
How is Robert Fischer's relationship
with his father?

531
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,800
Rumor is the relationship
is quite complicated.

532
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,400
Well, we can't work based
solely on rumor, can we?

533
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,800
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning.

534
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,100
Fischer Senior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.

535
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,600
It should be possible,
if you can get the right references.

536
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,200
References are something
of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

537
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,800
I'm not smelling
settlement here. Take them down.

538
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,100
Mr. Browning...

539
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:54,100
...Maurice Fischer's policy
is always one of avoiding litigation.

540
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:01,100
Well, shall we voice your concerns
with Maurice directly?

541
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,700
Not sure that's necessary.

542
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,500
No, no, no. I think we should.

543
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,400
How is he?

544
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,000
I don't want to bother him
unnecessarily, but--

545
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:37,600
Robert, I told you keep out
the damn-- Wait. So do it. Get--

546
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,000
- Mr. Fischer.
- Put it through.

547
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,900
Never, never.
Never do the same as I asked.

548
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,900
Leave that.

549
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,000
Here.

550
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,700
Must be a cherished memory of his.

551
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,300
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

552
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,100
Robert...

553
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,900
...we need to talk about
a power of attorney.

554
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:13,400
- I know this is hard, but it's imperative--
- Not now, Uncle Peter.

555
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,200
The vultures are circling.

556
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,800
And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,
the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.

557
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,300
I've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

558
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,300
...and adopt his physical presence, study his
mannerisms, and so on and so forth.

559
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:35,400
So now in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.

560
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,800
And suggest concepts
to Fischer's conscious mind.

561
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,800
Then, when we take him
a level deeper...

562
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,400
...his own projection of Browning
should feed that right back to him.

563
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,500
So he gives himself the idea.

564
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,900
Precisely. That's the only way it will stick.
It has to seem self-generated.

565
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,500
Eames, I am impressed.

566
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,200
Your condescension, as always,
is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.

567
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,600
Were you going under on your own?

568
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,300
No, no, I was just, uh, running
some experiments.

569
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,400
I didn't realize anyone was here, so....

570
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,300
Yeah, I was just--
I was working on my totem, actually.

571
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,600
Here, let me take a look.

572
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,100
So you're learning, huh?

573
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,700
An elegant solution
for keeping track of reality.

574
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,800
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was, uh....

575
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,100
It was Mal's, actually. This....

576
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,500
This one was hers. She would spin it
in the dream and it would never topple.

577
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,600
Just spin and spin.

578
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,100
Arthur told me she passed away.

579
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,100
How are the mazes coming along?

580
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,200
Each level relates to the part
of the subject's subconscious...

581
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,800
...that we are trying to access.

582
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,400
So I'm making the bottom level a hospital,
so Fischer will bring his father.

583
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,500
You know, l-- Actually, I have a question
about this layout.

584
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:17,400
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

585
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,800
Why is that so important?

586
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,900
In case one of us brings in
our projections.

587
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,400
We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

588
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,300
You mean in case you bring Mal in.

589
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,900
You can't keep her out, can you?

590
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,300
- Right.
- You can't build...

591
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,800
...because if you know the maze,
then she knows it.

592
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,200
Well, she'd sabotage
the whole operation.

593
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,100
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.

594
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,500
You've gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

595
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,600
No one said it's getting worse.

596
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,100
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.

597
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,100
Why can't you go home?

598
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,200
Because they think I killed her.

599
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,700
- Thank you.
- For what?

600
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,200
For not asking whether I did.

601
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,500
"I will split up my father's empire."

602
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:12,900
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

603
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,900
...which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.

604
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,600
The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

605
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:23,500
We need to find a way to translate this
into an emotional concept.

606
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,100
How do you translate business strategy
into emotion?

607
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,900
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...

608
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,800
- ...is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?

609
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:36,500
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a "screw you" to the old man.

610
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,200
No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

611
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,300
We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.

612
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,200
We need Robert Fischer to have
a positive emotional reaction to all this.

613
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,200
All right, well, try this. Um....

614
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,100
"My father accepts that I want to create
for myself, not follow in his footsteps."

615
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,600
That might work.

616
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,900
Might? We're gonna need to do
a little better than "might."

617
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,100
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.

618
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,200
Forgive me for wanting
a little specificity, Eames.

619
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,500
Specificity?

620
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,500
Inception's not about being specific.

621
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,600
When we get inside his mind, we're
gonna have to work with what we find.

622
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,900
On the top level, we open up
his relationship with his father...

623
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,200
...and say, "I will not follow
in my father's footsteps."

624
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:25,000
Then the next level down, we feed him,
"I will create something for myself."

625
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,500
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level,
we bring out the big guns.

626
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,100
- "My father doesn't want me to be him."
- Exactly.

627
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,400
Three layers down, the dreams are gonna
collapse with the slightest disturbance.

628
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,800
Sedation.

629
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,800
For sleep stable enough to create
three layers of dreaming...

630
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,800
...we'll have to combine it with
an extremely powerful sedative.

631
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,400
Good night.

632
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,200
The compound we'll be using
to share the dream...

633
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,300
...creates a clear connection
between dreamers...

634
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,700
- ...whilst accelerating brain function.
- In other words, more time on each level.

635
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,000
Brain function in the dream will be
about 20 times normal.

636
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,700
And when you enter a dream within
that dream, the effect is compounded.

637
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,900
It's three dreams,
that's 10 hours times 20--

638
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:19,000
Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?

639
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,800
It's a week, the first level down.

640
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,400
Six months the second level down,
and the third level--

641
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,000
That's 10 years.

642
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,800
Who'd wanna be stuck
in a dream for 10 years?

643
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,400
Depends on the dream.

644
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,800
So once we've made the plant,
how do we get out?

645
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,300
I'm hoping you have something more
elegant than shooting me in the head.

646
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,300
- A kick.
- What's a kick?

647
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,100
EAMES:This, Ariadne, would be a kick.

648
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,000
It's that feeling of falling you get
that jolts you awake.

649
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,400
- Snaps you out of the dream.
- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?

650
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,700
That's the clever part.

651
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,200
I customized the sedative to leave
inner-ear function unimpaired.

652
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:03,200
That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.

653
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,700
Or tipping.

654
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,500
The trick is to synchronize a kick
that can penetrate all three levels.

655
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,600
We could use a musical countdown
to synchronize the different kicks.

656
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,900
He hasn't got any surgery
scheduled, no dental, nothing.

657
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,100
Wasn't he supposed to have
a knee operation?

658
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:31,500
Nothing. Nothing that they'll
put him under for, anyway. And we need--

659
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,600
We need at least a good 10 hours.

660
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,100
Sydney to Los Angeles.

661
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:40,700
One of the longest flights in the world.
He makes it every two weeks.

662
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,100
He must be flying private, then.

663
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,700
Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.

664
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,100
- It would have to be a 747.
- Why's that?

665
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,800
On a 747, the pilot's up top...

666
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,100
...the first-class cabin's in the nose,
so no one would walk through.

667
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,800
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin
and the first-class flight attendant.

668
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,500
I bought the airline.

669
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,900
It seemed neater.

670
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,300
Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.

671
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,100
Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.

672
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,300
You know how to find me.

673
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,200
You know what you have to do.

674
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:11,500
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

675
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,400
Of course I do.

676
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,000
You said you had a dream.

677
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,700
That we'd grow old together.

678
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,900
And we can.

679
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,500
You shouldn't be here.

680
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,700
Just wanted to see what kind of tests
you're doing on your own every night.

681
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,100
- This has nothing to do with you.
- This has everything to do with me.

682
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:52,100
- You've asked me to share dreams with you.
- Not these. These are my dreams.

683
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,300
Why do you do this to yourself?

684
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,400
It's the only way I can still dream.

685
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,400
Why is it so important to dream?

686
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,600
In my dreams, we're still together.

687
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,700
These aren't just dreams.

688
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,500
These are memories.
And you said never to use memories.

689
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,700
I know I did.

690
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,900
You're trying to keep her alive.
You can't let her go.

691
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,100
You don't understand.
These are moments I regret.

692
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,800
They're memories that I have to change.

693
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,500
Well, what's down there that you regret?

694
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,100
Listen, there's only one thing
you need to understand about me.

695
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,100
This is your house?

696
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,300
Mine and Mal's, yes.

697
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,100
Where is she?

698
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,800
She's already gone.

699
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,100
That's my son, James.

700
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,300
He's digging for something,
maybe a worm.

701
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:25,900
That's Phillipa.

702
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,300
I thought about calling out to them...

703
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,200
...so they'd turn and smile
and I could see...

704
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:37,000
...those beautiful faces of theirs,
but it's all too late.

705
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,000
Right now or never, Cobb.

706
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,300
Then I start to panic.

707
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,200
I realize I'm gonna regret this moment...

708
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,300
...that I need to see their faces
one last time.

709
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,000
James! Phillipa! Come on in!

710
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,200
But the moment's past.

711
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,800
And whatever I do,
I can't change this moment.

712
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,900
As I'm about to call out to them...

713
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,000
...they run away.

714
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:14,000
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again,
I've gotta get back home.

715
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,500
The real world.

716
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,600
What are you doing here?

717
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,500
My name is--

718
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:05,000
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

719
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,600
I'm just trying to understand.

720
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,900
How could you understand?

721
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,200
Do you know what it is to be a lover?

722
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,400
To be half of a whole?

723
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,200
No.

724
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,600
I'll tell you a riddle.

725
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,400
You're waiting for a train.

726
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,600
A train that will take you far away.

727
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

728
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,300
...but you don't know for sure.

729
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,300
But it doesn't matter.

730
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:53,700
How can it not matter to you
where that train will take you?

731
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,600
Because you'll be together.

732
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,800
- How could you bring her here, Dom?
- What is this place?

733
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,300
This is a hotel suite where we
used to spend our anniversary.

734
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,800
What happened here?

735
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,600
You promised!
You promised we'd be together!

736
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,100
Please, I need you to stay here
just for now!

737
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:15,500
You said we'd be together!
You said we'd grow old together!

738
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:18,100
I'll come back for you. I promise.

739
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:41,700
Do you think you can just build
a prison of memories to lock her in?

740
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,700
Do you really think that
that's gonna contain her?

741
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,900
It's time.

742
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,500
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

743
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,800
- When's the funeral?
- Thursday. In Los Angeles.

744
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,200
Robert should accompany the body
no later than Tuesday. We should move.

745
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,900
All right.

746
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,500
- Cobb, I'm coming with you.
- I promised Miles. No.

747
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,800
The team needs someone who
understands what you're struggling with.

748
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,500
And it doesn't have to be me...

749
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:13,000
...but then you have to show Arthur
what I just saw.

750
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,500
Get us another seat on the plane.

751
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,600
If I get on this plane
and you don't honor our agreement...

752
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,400
...when we land,
I go to jail for the rest of my life.

753
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,300
Complete the job en route...

754
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,900
...I make one phone call from the plane...

755
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:40,000
...you have no trouble
getting through lmmigration.

756
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,300
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

757
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,000
Thank you.

758
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,900
Excuse me, I think this is yours?
You must have dropped it.

759
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,000
Would you care for a drink?

760
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,400
Oh. Water, please.

761
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,900
Oh, um, same, please.

762
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:43,200
Um....

763
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,000
Thank you.

764
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,000
You know, I couldn't help but notice...

765
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,800
...but you wouldn't happen to be related
to the Maurice Fischer, would you?

766
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,500
Yes, he, um....

767
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,400
He was my father.

768
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:59,900
Well, he was a very inspiring figure.
I'm sorry for your loss.

769
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,500
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

770
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,000
Hey.

771
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,100
To your father.

772
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,900
May he rest in peace, huh?

773
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,700
- Couldn't have peed before you went under?
- Sorry.

774
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,900
Bit too much free champagne
before takeoff?

775
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,200
Ha, ha, bloody ha.

776
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,300
We know he's gonna be looking for a taxi
in this weather.

777
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
- Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try--?
- Walk away.

778
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,300
Just have him ca-- I gotta go.

779
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,600
All right. Taxi. Thank you.

780
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,400
All right, Third and Market. Snappy.

781
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,300
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, I thought it was free.

782
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,000
- It's not.
- Maybe we could share.

783
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,000
Maybe not.
Can you pull over and get this--?

784
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,300
Great.

785
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,700
Come on.

786
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,400
There's $500 in there.
The wallet's worth more than that.

787
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,300
You might at least drop me at my stop.

788
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,600
I'm afraid that it doesn't--

789
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,100
- Cover him!
- Down! Down now!

790
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,900
What the hell is going on?

791
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,900
This wasn't in the design.

792
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,200
Cobb?

793
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,400
Cobb?

794
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,600
Get him!

795
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,700
Are you all right?

796
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,000
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

797
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,100
Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick.

798
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,500
Saito?

799
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,600
Get Fischer in the back room now.

800
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,600
- Get him in the back room. Move.
- What the hell happened?

801
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,500
Has he been shot? Is he dying?

802
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,400
- I don't know.
- Jesus Christ.

803
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,000
- What happened to you?
- Blocked by a freight train.

804
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:46,100
Why put a train
in a downtown intersection?

805
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:47,900
- I didn't.
- Where'd it come from?

806
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,700
Why the hell were we ambushed?

807
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:53,300
Those were not normal projections.
They'd been trained, for God's sakes.

808
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,000
- How could he be trained?
- Fischer's had an extractor...

809
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:00,400
...teach his subconscious to defend itself,
so his subconscious is militarized.

810
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,200
It should've shown in the research.

811
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,200
- Why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.

812
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:05,700
Don't tell me to calm down!

813
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,800
This was your job, goddamn it!
This was your responsibility!

814
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,000
You were meant to check
Fischer's background!

815
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,500
- We are not prepared for this!
- We have dealt with sub-security before!

816
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,800
We'll be more careful
and we're gonna be fine!

817
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,700
This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying.

818
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,000
Put him out his misery.

819
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:23,000
- No, don't do that! Don't do that.
- Cobb, hey, hey.

820
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,200
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.

821
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,300
No. It won't wake him up.

822
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:31,100
What do you mean, it won't wake him up?
When we die in a dream, we wake up.

823
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,500
Not from this.

824
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:35,200
We're too heavily sedated
to wake up that way.

825
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,500
Right. So, what happens when we die?

826
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,500
- We drop into limbo.
- Are you serious?

827
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,200
- Limbo?
- Unconstructed dream space.

828
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,700
- Well, what the hell is down there?
- Just raw, infinite subconscious.

829
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,000
Nothing is down there, except for
what might have been left behind...

830
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,100
...by anyone sharing the dream
who's been trapped there before.

831
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,200
Which, in our case, is just you.

832
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:57,000
- How long could we be stuck?
- Can't even think about...

833
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,600
- ...trying to escape until the sedation--
- How long?

834
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,000
Decades. It could be infinite.
Ask him, he's the one who's been there.

835
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,400
Let's get him upstairs.

836
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,500
Great.

837
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,900
Thank you.

838
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,900
So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind,
battling his own private army.

839
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,500
And if we get killed...

840
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,900
...we'll be lost in limbo till our brains
turn to scrambled egg, hmm?

841
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,600
Someone got first aid?

842
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:33,400
- You knew these risks and didn't tell us?
- There weren't meant to be risks.

843
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,500
- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire.
- You had no right.

844
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:39,000
This was the only way
to go three layers deep.

845
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,200
You knew about this
and went along with it?

846
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,400
I trusted him.

847
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,500
When? When he promised you
half his share?

848
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,900
No. His whole share.
Besides, he said he'd done it before.

849
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,100
What, with Mal?
Because that worked so good?

850
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:53,700
That has nothing to do with it.
I did what I had to to get to my children.

851
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,800
You led us into a war zone
with no way out?

852
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
There is a way out. We continue on with
the job, and we do it as fast as possible...

853
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,500
...and we get out using the kick,
just like before.

854
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,100
Forget it. We go any deeper,
we just raise the stakes.

855
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:07,200
I am sitting this one out on this level.

856
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,800
Fischer's security
is surrounding this place.

857
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,200
Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

858
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,100
That means each and every one of us
will be killed. That I can guarantee you.

859
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:20,500
We have no other choice but to continue on
and do it as fast as possible.

860
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,500
Downwards is the only way forwards.

861
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,200
Get ready.

862
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,600
You, come on. Let's go shake him up.

863
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,500
I'm insured against kidnapping
for up to 10 million.

864
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:40,600
- This should be very simple.
- Shut up! It won't be.

865
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,000
In your father's office,
below the bookshelves...

866
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,200
...is his personal safe.
We need the combination.

867
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,000
I don't know any safe.

868
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,100
That doesn't mean
you don't know the combination.

869
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,100
Tell us what it is.

870
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,700
I don't know.

871
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,700
We have it on good authority
you do know.

872
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,200
Yeah? Whose authority?

873
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:11,200
- Five hundred dollars, this cost.
- What's inside it?

874
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:15,300
Cash, cards, lD. And this.

875
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:21,800
Useful?

876
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,600
Maybe.

877
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:25,900
You're on. You've got an hour.

878
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,300
An hour?

879
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,900
I was supposed to have all night
to crack this.

880
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,600
And Saito wasn't supposed
to be shot in the chest.

881
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,000
You've got one hour,
now get us something useful, please.

882
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,900
- What's that?
- Good authority.

883
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,900
Uncle Peter.

884
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,700
Just make them stop.

885
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,400
- The combination.
- I don't know it.

886
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,200
- Why does Browning say you do?
- I don't know.

887
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,800
Just let me talk to him
and I'll find out.

888
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,900
You have one hour. Start talking.

889
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:07,100
You all right?

890
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,300
You okay?

891
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,700
Those bastards have had at me
for two days.

892
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,800
They have someone with access
to your father's office.

893
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,900
- They're trying to open his safe.
- Yeah.

894
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,800
They thought I'd know the combination,
but I don't know it.

895
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:28,700
- Yeah, well, neither do l, so....
- What?

896
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,700
Maurice told me that when he passed,
you were the only one able to open it.

897
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,400
No, he never gave me any combination.

898
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:40,200
Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you
just didn't know it was a combination.

899
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,600
Well, what, then?

900
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,300
I don't know, some meaningful
combination of numbers...

901
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:48,400
...based on your experiences
with Maurice.

902
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:54,100
We didn't have very many, uh,
meaningful experiences together.

903
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,300
Perhaps after your mother died.

904
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:01,100
After my mother died,
you know what he told me?

905
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:08,300
"Robert,
there's really nothing to be said."

906
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,800
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.

907
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,700
I was 11, Uncle Peter.

908
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,700
- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.

909
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:21,500
When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense.

910
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,900
And if he dies?

911
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,500
Worst-case scenario?

912
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:28,400
When he wakes up,
his mind is completely gone.

913
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,600
Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.

914
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,500
I appreciate that, Saito.

915
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:38,700
But when you wake up, you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.

916
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,900
Limbo is gonna become your reality.

917
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:44,900
You're gonna be lost down there so long
that you're gonna become an old man.

918
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,700
Filled with regret?

919
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:49,200
Waiting to die alone.

920
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,000
No.

921
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,200
I'll come back.

922
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,600
And we'll be young men together again.

923
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:03,700
Breathe.

924
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,900
These people are gonna kill us
if we don't give them the combination.

925
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,000
- They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them.

926
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:13,000
They're gonna lock us in that van,
and then drive it into the river.

927
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,700
All right. What is in the safe?

928
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:16,900
Something for you.

929
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,700
Maurice always said
it was his most precious gift to you.

930
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,500
- A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

931
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:26,900
That's an alternate.

932
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:29,400
This would supersede the other
if you want it to.

933
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,200
It splits up the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow.

934
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:36,100
It'd be the end of the entire empire
as we know it.

935
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,800
Destroying my whole inheritance?

936
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,600
- Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know.

937
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,400
He loved you, Robert.

938
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,600
In his own way.

939
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,600
In his own way.

940
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:55,400
At the end...

941
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,900
...he called me in to his deathbed.

942
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,200
He could barely speak.

943
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:06,500
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

944
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:10,700
He pulled me close.

945
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,400
And I could only make out...

946
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:17,800
...one word.

947
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,400
"Disappointed."

948
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,300
When were you in limbo?

949
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:35,300
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.

950
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,900
- But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?

951
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:42,200
The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

952
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:46,400
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

953
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,000
And the truth that,
as we go deeper into Fischer...

954
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,000
...we're also going deeper into you.

955
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,100
And I'm not sure
we're gonna like what we find.

956
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:00,600
We were working together.

957
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:04,400
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

958
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,900
I kept pushing things.

959
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,700
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.

960
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:15,100
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there...

961
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:18,000
...that we could get trapped so deep...

962
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,100
...that when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...

963
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,300
...we lost sight of what was real.

964
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,900
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.

965
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,500
We did that for years.

966
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,600
We built our own world.

967
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,700
How long were you stuck there?

968
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:47,000
Something like 50 years.

969
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,500
Jesus.

970
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,200
How could you stand it?

971
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:58,100
It wasn't so bad at first,
feeling like gods.

972
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,400
Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

973
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,000
And what about for her?

974
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:14,400
She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.

975
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:21,000
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

976
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:26,400
Limbo became her reality.

977
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,600
What happened when you woke up?

978
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:33,800
Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

979
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:39,300
...to become old souls thrown back
into youth like that?

980
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:44,000
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.

981
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,700
Eventually, she told me the truth.

982
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:51,500
She was possessed by an idea.

983
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:57,300
This one very simple idea
that changed everything.

984
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,900
That our world wasn't real.

985
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:06,100
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...

986
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:09,000
...that in order to get back home...

987
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,100
...we had to kill ourselves.

988
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:22,200
- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections...

989
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,400
...that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.

990
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,200
- I'm their mother!
- Calm down.

991
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,700
I can tell the difference.

992
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,200
If this is my dream,
why can't I control this?

993
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,000
You don't know you're dreaming!

994
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,400
She was certain
there was nothing I could do...

995
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,400
...no matter how much I begged,
no matter how much I pleaded.

996
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,400
She wanted to do it,
but she could not do it alone.

997
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:52,100
She loved me too much, so she came up
with a plan on our anniversary.

998
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,000
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.

999
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:25,400
Just-- Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.

1000
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:30,000
No. I'm going to jump,
and you're coming with me.

1001
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,900
No, I'm not.

1002
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,100
Now, you listen to me.

1003
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:39,000
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up,
remember? You're gonna die.

1004
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:41,100
Now, just step back inside.

1005
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,000
Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

1006
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:46,100
We've talked enough.

1007
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,800
- Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge...

1008
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,700
- ...or I'll jump right now.
- Okay.

1009
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,800
We're gonna talk about this.

1010
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,800
All right?

1011
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:06,000
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.

1012
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.

1013
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,900
Take a second, think about our children.

1014
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:14,800
Think about James.

1015
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,200
Think about Phillipa, now.

1016
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,300
If I go without you,
they'll take them away anyway.

1017
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:23,800
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...

1018
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:27,600
...explaining how I'm fearful
for my safety.

1019
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,900
How you've threatened to kill me.

1020
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:37,400
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.

1021
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,300
Why did--? Why would you do this to me?

1022
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,300
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

1023
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:45,500
We're going home to our real children.

1024
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:49,300
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,
all right? Mal, look at me, please?

1025
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:50,800
You're waiting for a train.

1026
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:54,900
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.

1027
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,000
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!

1028
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:01,100
You know where you hope this train
will take you, but you can't know for sure.

1029
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,400
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.

1030
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,800
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.

1031
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,800
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!

1032
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,400
Jesus Christ!

1033
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:19,600
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

1034
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:24,000
It made it impossible for me to try
to explain the nature of her madness.

1035
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,400
So I ran.

1036
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,500
Right now, or never, Cobb.

1037
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:40,500
James! Phillipa! Come on in! Come on!

1038
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:41,800
All right, let's go.

1039
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:46,200
I left my children behind and I've been
trying to buy my way back ever since.

1040
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:50,600
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.

1041
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,100
But you are not responsible
for the idea that destroyed her.

1042
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:57,900
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

1043
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:03,000
...you have to forgive yourself,
and you're gonna have to confront her.

1044
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,000
But you don't have to do that alone.

1045
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,500
- No, you're not....
- I'm doing it for the others.

1046
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:13,200
Because they have no idea the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

1047
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,800
We have to move.

1048
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,400
Time's up.

1049
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,300
All right. I don't know any combination.

1050
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:27,600
- Not consciously, anyway.
- How about instinctively, huh?

1051
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:31,700
I got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination.

1052
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,700
Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.

1053
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:37,100
- I have no idea.
- Right now!

1054
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,600
I said, right now! Right now!

1055
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:43,600
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.

1056
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,500
You'll have to do better than that.

1057
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:53,000
All right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.

1058
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:01,500
We're worth more to you alive.
You hear me?

1059
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,300
What'd you get?

1060
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:11,200
Relationship with his father
is worse than we imagined.

1061
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:12,400
This helps us how?

1062
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,700
The stronger the issues,
the more powerful the catharsis.

1063
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:20,000
- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I'm working on that.

1064
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:23,700
Work faster.
The projections are closing in quick.

1065
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:27,400
We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.

1066
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:03,600
Damn it.

1067
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:06,700
You mustn't be afraid to dream
a little bigger, darling.

1068
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:26,500
We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

1069
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:30,700
- Destroy his one positive relationship?
- No, repair his relationship with his father...

1070
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:33,200
...whilst exposing his godfather's
true nature.

1071
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:36,300
We should charge Fischer a lot more
than Saito for this job.

1072
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,900
His security is gonna
get worse as we go deeper.

1073
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,500
- I think we run with Mr. Charles.
- No.

1074
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:43,400
- Who's Mr. Charles?
- Bad idea.

1075
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:47,100
The second we get into that hotel
his security's gonna be all over us.

1076
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:49,300
We run with Mr. Charles
like on the Stein job.

1077
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,900
- You've done it before?
- Yeah, and it didn't work.

1078
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,500
The subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

1079
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,700
Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?

1080
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:00,000
- I need some kind of distraction.
- No problem.

1081
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,400
How about a lovely lady
that I've used before?

1082
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,600
Listen to me.
You drive carefully, all right?

1083
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,200
Everything down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

1084
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:15,100
Don't jump too soon. We only got
one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.

1085
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:18,600
I'll play the music to let you know
it's coming. The rest is on you.

1086
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,600
- You ready?
- Ready!

1087
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:22,900
Sweet dreams.

1088
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:25,000
Am I boring you?

1089
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:29,500
I was telling you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your liking.

1090
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:34,000
Um, I have a lot on my mind.

1091
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,100
There goes Mr. Charles.

1092
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,500
Mr. Fischer, right?

1093
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:48,100
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing. I--

1094
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:49,400
Hmm.

1095
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,300
- And you must be?
- Leaving.

1096
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,600
In case you get bored.

1097
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:03,300
Must've blown you off.

1098
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:06,200
That is, unless her phone number
really is only six digits.

1099
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:12,800
Funny way to make friends,
someone stealing your wallet like that.

1100
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:19,000
Goddamn it. The wallet alone
is worth at least 500--

1101
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,300
About $500, right?

1102
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:23,500
Don't worry about it.
My people are already on it as we speak.

1103
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,600
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

1104
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:29,500
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer
against his own subconscious.

1105
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:31,000
And why don't you approve?

1106
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,100
It involves telling the mark
that he's dreaming...

1107
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:35,500
...which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.

1108
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,600
- Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
- Hmm.

1109
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:40,500
So now you've noticed how much time...

1110
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:43,300
...Cobb spends doing things
he says never to do.

1111
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,800
Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?

1112
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,400
- I'm sorry, but....
- Hold on! Wait!

1113
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:52,000
You look a bit perkier.

1114
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,500
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

1115
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,300
Turbulence on the plane?

1116
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:04,100
No, it's much closer.

1117
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:06,000
That's Yusuf's driving.

1118
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:16,800
Um, I'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?

1119
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,100
Rod Green from marketing.

1120
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,800
But that's not true at all, is it?

1121
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:26,400
My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?

1122
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,600
I'm the head of your security down here.

1123
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,800
Get out on a different floor,
keep moving.

1124
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:34,300
Dump the wallet.
Security will be looking for that.

1125
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:37,900
- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.

1126
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:43,200
Security, huh?

1127
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:47,900
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.

1128
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,600
I specialize in a very specific type
of security.

1129
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,700
Subconscious security.

1130
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:57,000
You're talking about dreams?

1131
01:27:57,100 --> 01:28:00,000
Are you talking about, um, extraction?

1132
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,400
I am here to protect you.

1133
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:18,400
Mr. Fischer, I'm here
to protect you in the event...

1134
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:22,000
...that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams.

1135
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:24,800
You're not safe here.

1136
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,200
They're coming for you.

1137
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,600
Strange weather, isn't it?

1138
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,600
You feel that?

1139
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:56,700
What's happening?

1140
01:28:56,900 --> 01:29:00,100
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream...

1141
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:03,200
...which is making his subconscious
look for the dreamer.

1142
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:06,400
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.

1143
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:15,300
- They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it was worth a shot.

1144
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
We should probably get out of here.

1145
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:36,800
You feel that? You've actually
been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.

1146
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Pay attention to the strangeness
of the weather, the shift in gravity.

1147
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:44,300
None of this is real. You're in a dream.

1148
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:51,400
Now, the easiest way
for you to test yourself...

1149
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:55,600
...is to try and remember how you arrived
at this hotel. Can you do that?

1150
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:57,800
Yeah, l....

1151
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,500
No, breathe, breathe.
Remember your training.

1152
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:05,800
Accept the fact that you're in a dream,
and I'm here to protect you. Go on.

1153
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,200
Mm-hm.

1154
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,800
- You're not real?
- No.

1155
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,400
No. I'm a projection
of your subconscious.

1156
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,600
I was sent here to protect you
in the event...

1157
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,700
...that extractors
tried to pull you into a dream.

1158
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:26,100
And I believe that's what's
going on right now, Mr. Fischer.

1159
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,200
Yeah.

1160
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,500
Okay.

1161
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,700
Okay.

1162
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,500
Can you get me out of here?

1163
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:40,000
Right away. Follow me.

1164
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,500
Hold on a second.

1165
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,300
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?

1166
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,800
These men were sent here
to abduct you, all right?

1167
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:07,500
If you want my help,
you have to remain calm.

1168
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,500
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.

1169
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:26,800
If this is a dream, I should just
kill myself to wake up, right?

1170
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,100
I wouldn't do that if I were you,
Mr. Fischer.

1171
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:32,800
I believe they have you sedated,
and if you pull that trigger...

1172
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,100
...you may not wake up.

1173
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:39,600
You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what I'm talking about.

1174
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:43,600
You remember the training.

1175
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:46,100
Remember what I said to you.

1176
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,100
Give me the gun.

1177
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:02,500
- This room should be directly below 528?
- Yeah.

1178
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:13,400
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.

1179
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,400
What do you remember
from before this dream?

1180
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:20,400
There was, um, a lot of gunfire.

1181
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:23,200
There was rain.

1182
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:25,300
Uncle Peter.

1183
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:29,200
- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.
- Where were they holding you?

1184
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:35,500
- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.

1185
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,800
You're in the back of a van.
Keep going.

1186
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,300
It had something to do with, um....

1187
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:43,800
Something to do with a safe.

1188
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,000
God, why is it so hard to remember?

1189
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:48,900
It's like trying to remember a dream
after you've woken up.

1190
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:50,800
Listen, it takes years of practice.

1191
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,400
You and Browning have been pulled
into this dream...

1192
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:56,300
...because they're trying to steal
something from your mind.

1193
01:32:56,500 --> 01:33:00,000
I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

1194
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,800
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!

1195
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,700
A combination. They demanded
the first numbers to pop into my head.

1196
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:08,600
They're trying to extract a number
from your subconscious.

1197
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,600
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

1198
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:16,500
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1199
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:19,500
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

1200
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:21,000
Five.

1201
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,400
Five, two-- It was something,
it was a long number.

1202
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,700
That's good. We can start there.
Fifth floor.

1203
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:27,900
Yep.

1204
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:32,100
- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.

1205
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:35,600
While you're all asleep in 528,
I wait for Yusuf's kick.

1206
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:37,900
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.

1207
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:42,000
And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

1208
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:45,300
So we get a nice synchronized kick.

1209
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,900
If it's too soon,
we won't get pulled out.

1210
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:51,400
But if it's too late,
I won't be able to drop us.

1211
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:55,300
- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in freefall.

1212
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:58,700
- Can't drop you without gravity.
- Right.

1213
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:06,600
They're with me. Go on.

1214
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:31,900
Mr. Charles.

1215
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:35,100
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
- Yeah, I think so.

1216
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,300
They were trying to put you under.

1217
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:39,800
- I'm already under.
- Under again.

1218
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,500
What do you mean,
a dream within a dream?

1219
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:45,600
Hey. I see you've changed.

1220
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,400
I'm sorry?

1221
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:51,800
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mistook you for a friend.

1222
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,200
Oh.

1223
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,500
Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.

1224
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:59,100
No, no, no. That's Fischer's
projection of Browning.

1225
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:01,200
Let's follow him
and see how he behaves.

1226
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:03,300
- Why?
- Because how he acts will tell us...

1227
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:06,800
...if Fischer is starting to suspect
his motives the way we want him to.

1228
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Shh.

1229
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:15,100
- Uncle Peter.
- You said you were kidnapped together?

1230
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,700
Well, not exactly. They already had him.
They were torturing him.

1231
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,300
And you saw them torture him?

1232
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:29,700
The kidnappers are working for you?

1233
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:32,100
Robert.

1234
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:36,100
You're trying to get that safe open?
To get the alternate will?

1235
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:40,800
Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.
I can't let you destroy it.

1236
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:43,300
I'm not gonna throw away
my inheritance.

1237
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:47,600
I couldn't let you rise
to your father's last taunt.

1238
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,500
- What taunt?
- The will, Robert. That will?

1239
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,600
That's his last insult.

1240
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:57,400
A challenge for you to build something
for yourself...

1241
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,400
...by telling you you're not worthy
of his accomplishments.

1242
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:12,400
- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
- I'm sorry.

1243
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:16,900
But he's wrong.

1244
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,200
You can build a better company
than he ever did.

1245
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,800
Mr. Fischer? He's lying.

1246
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,100
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.

1247
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:28,000
He's hiding something,
and we need to find out what that is.

1248
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:32,700
I need you to do the same thing to him
that he was going to do to you.

1249
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:39,300
We'll enter his subconscious and find out
what he doesn't want you to know.

1250
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,000
All right.

1251
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,300
- He's out.
- Wait.

1252
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,500
Whose subconscious are
we going into exactly?

1253
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:53,000
We're going into Fischer's.

1254
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,900
I told him it was Browning's
so he'd be a part of our team.

1255
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,400
He's gonna help us break
into his own subconscious.

1256
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:00,100
That's right.

1257
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:02,300
Security's gonna run you down hard.

1258
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:04,900
And I will lead them on a merry chase.

1259
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:08,000
- Just be back before the kick.
- Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

1260
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:14,500
You good?

1261
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,000
Hey. You ready?

1262
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:22,700
Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready.

1263
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:36,600
Cobb?

1264
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:39,700
Cobb? What's down there?

1265
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,700
Hopefully, the truth
we want Fischer to learn.

1266
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:47,800
I mean, what's down there for you?

1267
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:26,200
Did you see that?

1268
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:46,500
Eames, this is your dream.

1269
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:49,800
I need you to draw the security away
from the complex, understand?

1270
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,800
- Who guides Fischer in?
- Not me.

1271
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:54,400
If I know the route,
everything could be compromised.

1272
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:57,100
- I designed the place.
- No, you're with me.

1273
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:58,800
I could do it.

1274
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:01,700
All right. Brief him on the route
into the complex.

1275
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:06,100
- Fischer, you'll be going with him.
- All right. What about you?

1276
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:09,100
You keep this live.
I'll be listening in the whole time.

1277
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:13,400
The windows on that upper floor are big
enough for me to cover you from that tower.

1278
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:14,800
You're not coming in?

1279
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,300
In order to find out the truth
about your father...

1280
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:20,500
...you're gonna need to break into
Browning's mind on your own.

1281
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:22,900
Come on, Fischer!

1282
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,600
- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
- Go, go, go!

1283
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,300
Move!

1284
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:25,900
Go!

1285
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:42,200
Sod it.

1286
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,000
I hope you're ready.

1287
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:05,500
No, it's too soon.

1288
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:13,200
Cobb, do you hear that?

1289
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:17,000
I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago,
I thought it was the wind up here.

1290
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:20,000
Yeah, I hear it. It's music.

1291
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:21,600
So, what do we do?

1292
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:23,200
We move fast.

1293
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:30,900
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.

1294
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:35,100
Which gives Arthur three minutes.

1295
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:38,200
- Hey!
- That's him!

1296
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,600
- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.

1297
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:44,000
- Can they make that route in an hour?
- They have to climb to the terrace.

1298
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:47,100
Then they need a new route,
a more direct route.

1299
01:43:58,300 --> 01:43:59,900
It's designed as a labyrinth.

1300
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:02,500
There must be access routes
that cut through the maze.

1301
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:04,300
Eames?

1302
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:28,700
Did Eames add any features?

1303
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,300
I don't think I should tell you.

1304
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:32,800
We don't have time for this.
Did he add anything?

1305
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:36,000
He added an air-duct system
that can cut through the maze.

1306
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:37,300
Good. Explain it to them.

1307
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:38,700
- Saito?
- Go ahead.

1308
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:13,600
Paradox.

1309
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,600
- What was that?
- The kick.

1310
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:28,100
Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?

1311
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:29,900
Yeah, we missed it.

1312
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:31,300
Man.

1313
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:35,800
Couldn't someone have dreamt up
a goddamn beach? Huh?

1314
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,200
Uh-huh.

1315
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,100
Well, what the hell do we do now?

1316
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:42,100
We finish the job before the next kick.

1317
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:44,400
- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.

1318
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:10,700
If you'd like to
make a call, please hang up and try again.

1319
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:12,700
If you need help, hang up....

1320
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:16,200
How do I drop you without gravity?

1321
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:21,400
Arthur has a couple minutes,
and we have about 20.

1322
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,500
You okay?

1323
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,800
Run! Turn around!
Move to base! Move to base!

1324
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,500
Go, go, go!

1325
01:47:58,700 --> 01:47:59,900
There's something wrong.

1326
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,400
They're heading your way,
like they know something.

1327
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,800
Just buy us more time, all right?

1328
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,800
- Come on!
- On my way.

1329
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,700
Come on! Move!

1330
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,500
All right.

1331
01:49:47,700 --> 01:49:50,500
Okay. That's the antechamber
outside the strong room.

1332
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:54,200
- Does the strong room have windows?
- lt wouldn't be very strong if it did.

1333
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:56,600
Let's hope Fischer likes
what he finds in there.

1334
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:01,600
- Are those projections his subconscious?
- Yes.

1335
01:50:01,700 --> 01:50:05,100
- Are you destroying parts of his mind?
- No. They're just projections.

1336
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:33,100
- We're here.
- You're clear, but hurry.

1337
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:35,100
There's an entire army headed your way.

1338
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,300
I'm in.

1339
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:09,800
There he is.

1340
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:55,000
- There's someone in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.

1341
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:58,800
Come on. Come on, a little lower.

1342
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:05,700
Cobb.

1343
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:08,800
No, she is not real.

1344
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:10,700
How do you know that?

1345
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:14,500
She is just a projection.
Fischer. Fischer is real.

1346
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:20,000
Hello.

1347
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:27,900
Eames!
Eames, get to the antechamber now!

1348
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:14,700
- What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.

1349
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
I couldn't shoot her.

1350
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:23,000
There's no use in reviving him.
His mind's already trapped down there.

1351
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:24,300
It's all over.

1352
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,600
So that's it, then? We failed?

1353
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:30,400
We're done. I'm sorry.

1354
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:36,900
It's not me that doesn't get back
to my family, is it?

1355
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:41,500
Shame. I wanted to know what was
gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.

1356
01:53:41,700 --> 01:53:43,800
Let's set the charges.

1357
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:47,100
No, there's still another way.

1358
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:51,800
- We have to follow Fischer down there.
- Not enough time.

1359
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,800
No, but there will be enough time
down there.

1360
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,100
And we will find him.

1361
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:01,200
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in,
just use the defibrillator to revive him.

1362
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:04,200
We can give him his own kick
down below.

1363
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:07,000
Look, you get him in there.

1364
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:10,000
As soon as the music ends,
you blow up the hospital...

1365
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:13,000
...and we all ride the kick
back up the layers.

1366
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:18,900
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold
the guards off while I set the charges.

1367
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:21,200
Saito will never make it, will he?

1368
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:25,700
- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
- Go for it.

1369
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:28,800
If you are not back before the kick,
I am gone with or without you.

1370
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,200
She's right. She's right.
Come on. Let's go.

1371
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:38,700
Can I trust you to do
what needs to happen here?

1372
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:40,000
Mal's gonna be down there.

1373
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:42,600
I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.

1374
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:46,700
- How do you know?
- Because she wants me to come after him.

1375
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:49,000
She wants me back down there with her.

1376
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:16,800
All right?

1377
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:26,700
- This is your world?
- lt was.

1378
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:29,500
And this is where she'll be.

1379
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:31,800
Come on.

1380
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:20,700
Saito. Saito.

1381
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:25,100
I need you to take care of Fischer
while I go set some charges, okay?

1382
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:28,700
No room for tourists on these jobs.

1383
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:32,500
Don't be silly.

1384
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:07,100
You built all this? This is incredible.

1385
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:09,600
We built for years.

1386
01:57:10,700 --> 01:57:12,600
Then we started in on the memories.

1387
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:21,100
This way.

1388
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:04,900
This was our neighborhood.

1389
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,400
Places from our past.

1390
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:09,300
That was our first apartment.

1391
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:11,700
Then we moved to that building
right there.

1392
01:58:11,900 --> 01:58:14,400
After Mal became pregnant,
that became our home.

1393
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:17,400
You reconstructed all of this
from memory?

1394
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:19,800
Like I told you, we had lots of time.

1395
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,600
What is that?

1396
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:24,900
That's the house Mal grew up in.

1397
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:27,500
- Well, will she be in there?
- No.

1398
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:28,900
Come on.

1399
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,400
We both wanted to live in a house,
but we loved this type of building.

1400
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:35,500
In the real world,
we'd have to choose, but not here.

1401
01:59:16,100 --> 01:59:18,100
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?

1402
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:20,900
We're gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.

1403
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:22,500
What?

1404
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:24,700
I'm gonna improvise.

1405
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:29,500
Listen, there's something you should
know about me. About inception.

1406
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:46,500
An idea is like a virus. Resilient.

1407
01:59:47,300 --> 01:59:48,900
Highly contagious.

1408
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:52,400
And the smallest seed
of an idea can grow.

1409
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:55,400
It can grow to define...

1410
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:58,000
...or destroy you.

1411
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:03,900
The smallest idea, such as:

1412
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:06,900
"Your world is not real."

1413
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:10,900
Simple little thought
that changes everything.

1414
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:16,700
So certain of your world. Of what's real.

1415
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:18,600
Do you think he is?

1416
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:23,300
Or do you think he's as lost as I was?

1417
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:26,000
I know what's real, Mal.

1418
02:00:28,100 --> 02:00:30,400
No creeping doubts?

1419
02:00:31,100 --> 02:00:33,700
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?

1420
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,300
Chased around the globe...

1421
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:38,200
...by anonymous corporations
and police forces...

1422
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:41,000
...the way the projections
persecute the dreamer?

1423
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:44,100
Admit it.

1424
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:48,200
You don't believe in one reality anymore.

1425
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:49,900
So choose.

1426
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:52,300
Choose to be here.

1427
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:54,300
Choose me.

1428
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:21,500
You know what I have to do.

1429
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:24,300
I have to get back to our children
because you left them.

1430
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:27,200
Because you left us.

1431
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:29,100
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

1432
02:01:29,300 --> 02:01:31,300
You're confused.

1433
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:34,500
Our children are here.

1434
02:01:35,300 --> 02:01:38,600
And you'd like to see their faces again,
wouldn't you?

1435
02:01:38,700 --> 02:01:41,800
Yes, but I'm gonna see them
up above, Mal.

1436
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:57,400
Up above?

1437
02:01:58,300 --> 02:02:02,000
Listen to yourself.
These are our children.

1438
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:03,900
Watch.

1439
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:06,100
James? Phillipa?

1440
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:08,700
Don't do this, Mal. Please.
Those aren't my children.

1441
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:11,300
You keep telling yourself that,
but you don't believe it.

1442
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:13,400
- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?

1443
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:16,100
What if I'm what's real?

1444
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:19,500
You keep telling yourself what you know.

1445
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:23,300
But what do you believe?

1446
02:02:24,300 --> 02:02:25,500
What do you feel?

1447
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:29,100
Guilt.

1448
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:32,500
I feel guilt, Mal.

1449
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:37,000
And no matter what I do,
no matter how hopeless I am...

1450
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:41,500
...no matter how confused,
that guilt is always there...

1451
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:44,100
...reminding me of the truth.

1452
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:46,000
What truth?

1453
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:53,600
That the idea that caused you to question
your reality came from me.

1454
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,100
You planted the idea in my mind?

1455
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:03,100
What is she talking about?

1456
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:09,300
The reason I knew inception was possible
was because I did it to her first.

1457
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:13,300
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?

1458
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:15,500
We were lost in here.

1459
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:21,100
I knew we needed to escape,
but she wouldn't accept it.

1460
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:30,000
She had locked something away,
something deep inside.

1461
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:34,900
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

1462
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:38,000
And she couldn't break free.

1463
02:03:40,700 --> 02:03:43,400
So I decided to search for it.

1464
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,900
I went deep into the recess of her mind
and found that secret place.

1465
02:03:49,100 --> 02:03:51,000
And I broke in...

1466
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:53,700
...and I planted an idea.

1467
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:58,200
A simple little idea
that would change everything.

1468
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:05,800
That her world wasn't real.

1469
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:21,800
That death was the only escape.

1470
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:31,000
You're waiting for a train.

1471
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:36,000
A train that'll take you far away.

1472
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:40,200
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

1473
02:04:41,300 --> 02:04:43,300
...but you can't know for sure.

1474
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:46,000
Yet it doesn't matter.

1475
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:50,600
- Now, tell me why!
- Because you'll be together!

1476
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:59,100
But I never knew that that idea
would grow in her mind like a cancer...

1477
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:01,600
...that even after she woke....

1478
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:07,000
That even after
you came back to reality...

1479
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:12,900
...that you'd continue to believe
your world wasn't real.

1480
02:05:15,700 --> 02:05:18,100
That death was the only escape.

1481
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:20,900
Mal, no! Jesus!

1482
02:05:21,100 --> 02:05:24,800
- You infected my mind.
- I was trying to save you.

1483
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,400
You betrayed me.

1484
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:30,900
But you can make amends.
You can still keep your promise.

1485
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:34,100
We can still be together, right here...

1486
02:05:34,300 --> 02:05:36,700
...in the world we built together.

1487
02:06:57,500 --> 02:06:59,900
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.

1488
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:02,000
You can't have him.

1489
02:07:03,100 --> 02:07:06,500
- lf I stay here, will you let him go?
- What are you talking about?

1490
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,800
Fischer is on the porch.

1491
02:07:13,400 --> 02:07:16,000
- Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.

1492
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:18,800
Go check he's alive right now. Do it.

1493
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:37,500
He's here! And it's time,
but you have to come now!

1494
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:41,400
- You take Fischer with you, all right?
- You can't stay here to be with her.

1495
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,700
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.

1496
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:50,300
That means he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.

1497
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:55,400
I can't stay with her anymore,
because she doesn't exist.

1498
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:59,000
I'm the only thing
you do believe in anymore.

1499
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:00,500
No.

1500
02:08:01,700 --> 02:08:03,100
I wish.

1501
02:08:04,700 --> 02:08:07,200
I wish more than anything, but...

1502
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:11,000
...I can't imagine you
with all your complexity...

1503
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:13,700
...all your perfection,
all your imperfection.

1504
02:08:14,900 --> 02:08:15,900
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1505
02:08:16,100 --> 02:08:17,900
Look at you.

1506
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:24,100
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my real wife.

1507
02:08:24,500 --> 02:08:27,100
And you were the best
that I could do, but...

1508
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,400
...I'm sorry, you're just not good enough.

1509
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:32,200
Does this feel real?

1510
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:37,200
- What are you doing?
- lmprovising.

1511
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:47,500
No, no, no!

1512
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:50,900
In there, now. Go, go, go.

1513
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:37,600
I was dis--

1514
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:41,700
I was dis-- Disa--

1515
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:45,100
- I know, Dad.
- Dis--

1516
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:53,200
I know you were disappointed...

1517
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,400
...I couldn't be you.

1518
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:57,200
No.

1519
02:09:57,900 --> 02:09:59,100
No, no, no.

1520
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:02,100
I was disappointed...

1521
02:10:03,900 --> 02:10:05,800
...that you tried.

1522
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:30,700
What?

1523
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:41,300
Come on, come on.

1524
02:11:11,500 --> 02:11:13,000
Dad?

1525
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:54,400
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!

1526
02:12:07,300 --> 02:12:10,700
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!

1527
02:12:10,900 --> 02:12:12,600
I will!

1528
02:12:52,300 --> 02:12:55,500
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

1529
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:56,700
Yes.

1530
02:12:56,900 --> 02:13:00,000
You said you dreamt
that we'd grow old together.

1531
02:13:02,700 --> 02:13:04,200
But we did.

1532
02:13:06,100 --> 02:13:08,500
We did. You don't remember?

1533
02:13:13,200 --> 02:13:16,000
I miss you more than I can bear...

1534
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:20,300
...but we had our time together.

1535
02:13:21,700 --> 02:13:23,800
And I have to let you go.

1536
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:27,700
I have to let you go.

1537
02:14:18,900 --> 02:14:20,200
I'm sorry, Robert.

1538
02:14:47,900 --> 02:14:51,500
You know, the will means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man...

1539
02:14:52,600 --> 02:14:54,600
...not just to live for him.

1540
02:14:56,300 --> 02:14:58,800
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.

1541
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:09,800
What happened?

1542
02:15:10,300 --> 02:15:12,000
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?

1543
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:13,400
No, to find Saito.

1544
02:15:15,700 --> 02:15:17,400
He'll be lost.

1545
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,800
No, he'll be all right.

1546
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:39,800
Have you come to kill me?

1547
02:15:44,100 --> 02:15:46,500
I'm waiting for someone.

1548
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,800
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

1549
02:15:56,500 --> 02:15:57,900
Cobb?

1550
02:15:59,900 --> 02:16:01,600
Impossible.

1551
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:04,700
We were young men together.

1552
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:08,700
I'm an old man.

1553
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:12,000
Filled with regret.

1554
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:17,800
Waiting to die alone.

1555
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,200
I've come back for you.

1556
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:30,300
To remind you of something.

1557
02:16:33,600 --> 02:16:36,000
Something you once knew.

1558
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:41,100
That this world is not real.

1559
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:50,500
To convince me to honor
our arrangement?

1560
02:16:51,300 --> 02:16:54,100
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1561
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:01,500
Come back...

1562
02:17:04,100 --> 02:17:07,400
...so we can be
young men together again.

1563
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:13,200
Come back with me.

1564
02:17:16,300 --> 02:17:17,700
Come back.

1565
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:29,100
Hot towel, sir?

1566
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:32,600
We'll be landing in Los Angeles
in about 20 minutes.

1567
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:35,100
Do you need immigration forms?

1568
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:38,500
Thank you.

1569
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,600
Hot towel, sir?

1570
02:17:41,700 --> 02:17:44,600
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?

1571
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:57,100
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

1572
02:18:58,200 --> 02:18:59,900
Thank you, sir.

1573
02:19:43,900 --> 02:19:45,300
Welcome.

1574
02:19:45,700 --> 02:19:47,100
This way.

1575
02:20:08,300 --> 02:20:11,800
James? Phillipa?

1576
02:20:15,500 --> 02:20:16,800
Look who's here.

1577
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:23,500
Hey.

1578
02:20:24,600 --> 02:20:27,300
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
- Daddy! Daddy!

1579
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:29,700
- Daddy!
- How are you?

1580
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:32,400
Look what I've been building!

1581
02:20:32,700 --> 02:20:36,400
- What are you building?
- We're building a house on the cliff!

1582
02:20:36,600 --> 02:20:39,400
On the cliff? Come on, I want you
to show me. Can you show me?

1583
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:42,200
- Let's go.
- Come on, Daddy!

1584
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:46,092
